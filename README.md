# Enfuser
A translator application where the main goal is to immerse yourself into the language you are learning and being able to scan all the text in your screen and paste it in.

It will also have a simple translator in the CLI with the hopes to make it look user friendly. 

Using the DEEPL API as the more robust translator in my opinion, the goal is to to choose what DEEPL has to offer and start immersing yourself.

Instructions are null due to it being unfinished, but once I feel like its sufficient for use I'll update the readme.

The goal of this product is for my own personal gain in just creating and boosting my understanding and delving into the unknown.
